# react-chronicles

A small learning repository for JavaScript and React exercises and examples.

This repo contains short, focused example scripts under the `Intro/` folder to experiment with plain JavaScript and the basics of building small frontend examples.

## Contents

- `Intro/hello-world.js` - simple hello world script.
- `Intro/array.js` - short examples working with arrays.
- `Intro/index.html` - basic HTML file (useful for small front-end demos).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (to run the example scripts). Any recent Node 14+ should work.

## Run the examples

From the project root you can run the JavaScript examples with Node:

```bash
node Intro/hello-world.js
node Intro/array.js
```

To view `Intro/index.html` open it in a browser, or serve the folder with a simple static server (for example `npx http-server Intro`).

## Contributing

Feel free to add small exercises, fix wording, or open issues describing what you'd like to learn next.

## License

This repository has no license specified. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to make the code reusable by others (MIT is a simple, permissive choice).

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- add a `package.json` with scripts to run the examples,
- add a short license file (MIT), or
- convert `Intro/index.html` into a tiny React demo.

Let me know which next step you want.
